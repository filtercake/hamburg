# NodeSchool Hamburg Sticker

This sticker was made by @oleharland based on @finnp logo idea, the
[nodeschool-sicker-guide](https://github.com/nodeschool/nodeschool.github.io/tree/master/images/make-a-sticker)
and the free-to-use [Hamburg symbol](http://www.hamburg.de/wappen/nofl/229554/hamburg-symbol-eps/).

Depending on the print shop it may be necessary to add cut marks or a colored
background layer. Please feel free to contact @oleharland for further support.
